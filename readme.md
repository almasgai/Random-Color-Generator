# Random Color Generator

Very basic program that creates a million by million display consisting of random colors. This was used in class as an argument for a ![fine-tuned universe] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe) in Philosophy 359.

The whole point of this is to show that there is no obvious or decipherable image to be made out of the output, regardless how often you run it.
